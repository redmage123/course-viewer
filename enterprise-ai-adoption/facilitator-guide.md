# Day-by-Day Facilitation

## Day 1: Foundations & Mindset Shift

### Opening (30 minutes)
**Icebreaker: "AI Confession"**
- Each participant shares one thing they've tried to do with AI (successful or not)
- Establishes psychological safety and shared starting point
- Note common themes for reference throughout day

**Setting Expectations**
- This is participatory, not passive
- All questions are welcome
- Goal is practical application, not theory

### Key Teaching Moments

**The "Automate vs. Redesign" Distinction**
- This is the most important concept of Day 1
- Use live polling: "If you had AI, what would you automate?"
- Then challenge: "But what if you could start fresh?"
- Draw the distinction clearly before proceeding

**Workflow Autopsy Exercise**
- Allow extra time - this exercise generates rich discussion
- Circulate among groups and ask probing questions:
  - "Why does this step exist?"
  - "What would happen if you skipped it?"
  - "Who decided it should be done this way?"
- Have groups share one surprising discovery

**AI Readiness Assessment**
- Some participants will score their organization harshly
- Validate frustrations but redirect to opportunity
- "Low readiness = high opportunity for impact"

### Common Challenges Day 1
| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're not ready for AI" | "That's what this course helps with" |
| "Our IT won't allow it" | "Day 4 covers building internal support" |
| "I don't have authority" | "You can propose; we'll help you build the case" |
| Participant dominates | "Let's hear from others at your table" |

### Closing Day 1
- Quick reflection: "One thing that surprised you today"
- Preview Day 2: "Tomorrow we map your actual workflows"
- Assign: Think of one workflow to redesign

---

## Day 2: Mapping and Redesigning Workflows

### Opening (15 minutes)
**Reconnection Activity**
- "Share one workflow you thought about since yesterday"
- Quick around-the-room (30 seconds each)
- Identifies workflows that will be used for exercises

### Key Teaching Moments

**Outcome Brief Creation**
- Stress: Start with outcome, NOT process
- Common mistake: Describing current process
- Good: "Customers can check order status instantly"
- Bad: "We need to automate the status lookup workflow"

**Before/After Workflow Mapping**
- This is the core exercise of Day 2
- Provide large paper and colored markers
- Color coding is important:
  - Blue: Human tasks
  - Green: AI tasks
  - Yellow: Decision points
- Groups will move slowly at first - that's okay
- Key facilitation: "What's the purpose of this step?"

**AI Role Types Exercise**
- After teaching the 5 types, have groups identify:
  - Which role types appear in their redesigned workflow?
  - Which role types could be added?
- This often sparks "aha" moments

### Live Workflow Mapping Session

**Setup (10 minutes)**
- Each table gets flip chart paper or whiteboard space
- Colored markers/sticky notes
- One workflow template per group

**Mapping Exercise (45 minutes)**
1. Groups select one workflow from their discussions
2. Map current state (15 minutes)
3. Identify pain points and opportunities (10 minutes)
4. Map AI-enhanced future state (20 minutes)

**Gallery Walk (20 minutes)**
- Post all workflows on walls
- Half the group stays to explain
- Other half rotates to view and ask questions
- Switch roles halfway through

**Debrief (15 minutes)**
- What patterns emerged across workflows?
- What surprised you about others' workflows?
- What ideas did you "steal"?

### Common Challenges Day 2
| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Groups stuck on "current state" | "Skip ahead - what would ideal look like?" |
| Workflow too complex | "Pick just one piece to focus on" |
| "AI can't do this" mindset | "What if it could? What would change?" |
| Groups moving too fast | "Slow down - where are the decision points?" |

## Day 3: Governance, Safety, and Human-in-the-Loop Design

### Opening (15 minutes)
**Discussion Starter**
- Share a recent AI failure headline
- Ask: "What went wrong here?"
- Connect to: "Today we learn to prevent this"

### Key Teaching Moments

**Risk Dimensions Framework**
- Walk through each dimension with examples
- Have participants rate one of their workflows on all 5 dimensions
- This makes abstract risk concrete

**Oversight Model Selection**
- This is often the most debated topic
- Use the role-play exercise (below) to make it real
- Push back on "always HITL" - "Is that sustainable at scale?"

**Governance Canvas**
- Complex template - go slowly
- Do first section together as a class
- Then have groups complete for their workflow

### Debate: "AI Should Never Make Final Decisions"

**Setup (5 minutes)**
- Divide room in half randomly
- One side argues FOR the statement
- One side argues AGAINST
- Assign sides regardless of personal opinion

**Debate (20 minutes)**
- Each side gets 3 minutes opening
- Then 10 minutes of rebuttals
- 4 minutes closing each side

**Debrief (10 minutes)**
- "Who changed their mind during the debate?"
- "What's the best argument from the other side?"
- Land on: "It depends on context - that's why we have frameworks"

### Common Challenges Day 3
| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "This is too cautious" | "Show me your risk mitigation plan" |
| "This is too risky" | "What controls would make you comfortable?" |
| Analysis paralysis on risk | "Perfect is enemy of good - start somewhere" |
| Governance seems bureaucratic | "Good governance enables speed" |

### Common Challenges Day 4
| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "My org won't approve this" | "Let's strengthen the business case" |
| Playbook feels theoretical | "Anchor every section to specific workflow" |
| Too much detail | "Executive summary first, details later" |
| Negative feedback discouraging | "Better to find gaps now than later" |

# Live Workflow Mapping

## Setup Requirements

### Physical Space
- Large whiteboard or flip chart paper (minimum 3' x 4')
- Colored markers: Blue, Green, Yellow, Red, Black
- Sticky notes in multiple colors
- Painter's tape for posting

### Digital Tools (for virtual)
- Miro, Mural, or FigJam board
- Pre-built template with color-coded elements
- Ensure all participants can edit

## Color Coding Standard

| Color | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Blue | Human task | "Manager reviews application" |
| Green | AI task | "AI extracts data from documents" |
| Yellow | Decision point | "Approve or escalate?" |
| Red | Pain point/risk | "2-day wait for review" |
| Black | Flow arrows | Connections between steps |

## Mapping Protocol

### Phase 1: Current State (15 minutes)
1. Start with trigger: "What starts this workflow?"
2. Map each step left to right
3. Mark all actors (who does each step)
4. Note time for each step
5. Mark pain points in red

### Phase 2: Analysis (10 minutes)
1. Circle steps that are: Repetitive, Error-prone, Time-consuming
2. Identify information flows
3. Note decision points
4. Calculate total time and touch points

### Phase 3: Future State (20 minutes)
1. Start with desired outcome (not current process)
2. Design from scratch - don't just "add AI" to current
3. Use green for AI-enabled steps
4. Define human checkpoints (HITL/HOTL/HOOTL)
5. Note expected time/quality improvements

### Facilitation Questions

**For Current State:**
- "Why does this step exist?"
- "What happens when there's an error here?"
- "How long does this really take (not what the manual says)?"
- "Who's waiting on this step?"

**For Future State:**
- "What's the actual outcome we need?"
- "If we started fresh today, what would we build?"
- "Where is human judgment truly needed?"
- "What could go wrong with this AI step?"

## Common Mapping Mistakes

| Mistake | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Too high-level | "Break this step down more" |
| Skipping exception paths | "What happens when this fails?" |
| All blue (no AI) | "Challenge: Where could AI help?" |
| All green (no human) | "Where are the risks? Add checkpoints" |
| No decision points | "Every workflow has decisions - find them" |

# Troubleshooting Common Challenges

## Participant Challenges

### The Dominator
**Symptoms:** One person talks constantly, others withdraw
**Solutions:**
- "Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet"
- Use structured turn-taking (round robin)
- Give dominators special role that requires listening (note-taker)

### The Skeptic
**Symptoms:** Constantly challenges, "This won't work here"
**Solutions:**
- Acknowledge concerns as valid
- Ask: "What would need to be true for you to try this?"
- Give them the "devil's advocate" role officially
- Pair with an enthusiast for group work

### The Silent Participant
**Symptoms:** Never volunteers, minimal participation
**Solutions:**
- Use written exercises before discussion
- Small group work before large group
- Direct questions: "What's your experience with X?"
- Check in privately at break

### The Off-Topic Questioner
**Symptoms:** Keeps raising issues outside scope
**Solutions:**
- Use "parking lot" for off-topic items
- "Great question - let's address that at break"
- "That's worth a separate conversation - let's connect after"

### The Overwhelmed Participant
**Symptoms:** Confusion, falling behind, anxious
**Solutions:**
- Pair with supportive peer
- Check in privately
- Provide additional materials
- Reassure: "Focus on what's useful for you"

## Technical Challenges

### Technology Failures
**Prevention:**
- Test everything day before
- Have backup slides (PDF, printed)
- Know IT support contact

**Recovery:**
- Stay calm
- Switch to discussion-based activities
- "Let's use this as a chance to talk through concepts"

### Virtual Delivery Issues
**Participant audio problems:**
- Have chat backup for contributions
- Assign "voice" buddy who can relay

**Tool access issues:**
- Have view-only option
- Facilitator can screen share and edit for participant

## Content Challenges

### "We Already Know This"
**Response:**
- "Great - then you'll be able to add depth to our discussions"
- Challenge them with advanced scenarios
- Ask them to share experiences
- Give them mentor role

### "This Doesn't Apply To Us"
**Response:**
- Ask: "What would apply? Let's adapt"
- Find analogies in their context
- Have them teach back using their examples

### Time Running Short
**Priority order if cutting:**
- Protect hands-on exercises
- Summarize lecture content
- Assign readings for self-study
- Never cut reflection time

### Time Running Long
**Options:**
- Cut optional debrief (but not reflection)
- Offer to stay during break
- Send follow-up materials
- Schedule optional follow-up session
