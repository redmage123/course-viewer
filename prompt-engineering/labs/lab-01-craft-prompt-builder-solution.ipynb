That's physically impossible in 100 words \u2014 each case study alone would need 100+ words. The word limit and content requirements directly contradict each other."

    "| 2 | **B** | Has real context (fintech, board meeting) but the scope is impossibly broad. Could be fixed by splitting into 5 separate prompts, one per deliverable. |\n",
    "| 3 (Worst) | **C** | Fundamentally unfixable without adding real information. Every specific detail is replaced with a vague pronoun. The AI literally cannot produce useful output because it has nothing concrete to work with. |\n",

    "**Justification:** Prompt A is most fixable (change one number). Prompt B is structurally broken but has real content buried inside. Prompt C is the worst because it has the appearance of structure without any actual information \u2014 it's the prompt equivalent of an empty suit. No amount of structural improvement helps if the AI doesn't know what company, industry, or options you're talking about.\n",
