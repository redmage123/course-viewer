    "In this hands-on lab, you'll learn to systematically construct high-quality prompts using the CRAFT framework. You'll evaluate prompt quality using a manual scoring rubric, diagnose flawed prompts, and build reusable templates \u2014 all by working directly with an AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Apply the CRAFT framework systematically to any business task\n",
    "- Diagnose and fix flawed prompts using a structured rubric\n",
    "- Critically evaluate when a prompt \"looks good\" but fails in practice\n",
    "- Build reusable prompt templates with placeholders\n",
    "- Adapt prompts for different audiences and stakeholders\n",
