    "- Apply the CRAFT framework systematically to any business task\n",
    "- Diagnose and fix flawed prompts using a structured rubric\n",
    "- Critically evaluate when a prompt \"looks good\" but fails in practice\n",

    "- Adapt prompts for different audiences and stakeholders\n",

Notice how rubric scores can be misleading.\n\n**These are examples for reference — your own prompts go in Part A and Part B below.**\n\n---\n\n#### Example 1: High Score, Terrible Prompt (Score: 21/25)\n\n> **Context:** Our multinational retail corporation operates in 14 countries and serves 2.3 million customers annually. The executive leadership team is preparing for the Q4 board review.\n>\n> **Role:** Act as a senior strategy consultant specializing in retail operations, supply chain optimization, and consumer psychology.\n>\n> **Action:** Write a 75-word report that includes a full competitive analysis of 15 major retailers, a 10-year demand forecast model for each of our 14 markets, a complete organizational restructuring plan with role-by-role headcount changes, and a customer sentiment analysis based on 500,000 survey responses.\n>\n> **Format:** Executive summary, 4 comparison tables, a numbered action plan with 25 items, and a risk matrix. Use bullet points for all findings.\n>\n> **Tone:** Authoritative, data-driven, and concise.\n\n| Dimension | Score | Why It Scores Well |\n|-----------|-------|--------------------|\n| Clarity | 4 | Language is precise and professional |\n| Specificity | 5 | Packed with exact numbers (14 countries, 15 retailers, 500K surveys) |\n| Context | 4 | Rich organizational context with audience identified |\n| Format | 4 | Multiple format elements requested |\n| Actionability | 4 | Clear action verbs with defined deliverables |\n| **TOTAL** | **21/25** | |\n\n**Why it fails:** The prompt demands content that would fill 50+ pages crammed into 75 words. The constraints are physically contradictory — you cannot fit 15 competitive analyses, 14 forecast models, a restructuring plan, and a sentiment analysis into 75 words. An AI will either ignore the word limit or produce meaningless fragments. **The rubric rewards the *appearance* of structure without checking whether the constraints are achievable.**\n\n---\n\n#### Example 2: Low Score, Effective Prompt (Score: 7/25)\n\n> Compare the pros and cons of microservices vs monolith for a 10-person startup.\n\n| Dimension | Score | Why It Scores Low |\n|-----------|-------|-------------------|\n| Clarity | 2 | Short, no elaboration |\n| Specificity | 2 | Only one concrete detail (\"10-person startup\") |\n| Context | 1 | No background, no audience, no industry |\n| Format | 1 | No format specified at all |\n| Actionability | 1 | Simple question, no defined deliverable |\n| **TOTAL** | **7/25** | |\n\n**Why it works:** The question is inherently focused — \"pros and cons\" constrains the structure, \"microservices vs monolith\" is a well-defined comparison, and \"10-person startup\" provides the key constraint. The AI will naturally produce a balanced comparison because the question implies one. **Sometimes a direct question with the right specificity outperforms an elaborately structured prompt.**\n\n---",
