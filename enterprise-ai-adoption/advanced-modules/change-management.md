## Module Outline

### Session 1: AI as an Organizational Change (60 minutes)

#### 1.1 Why AI Requires Change Management

**AI is Different from Previous Technology Changes**

| Aspect | Traditional IT Project | AI Adoption |
|--------|------------------------|-------------|
| Scope of impact | Defined system boundaries | Potentially any knowledge work |
| Predictability | Clear inputs → outputs | Probabilistic, sometimes surprising |
| User relationship | Tool usage | Collaboration/partnership |
| Job impact concerns | Efficiency improvement | Existential questions |
| Learning curve | Skill-based | Judgment-based |
| Trust requirement | System reliability | Output evaluation |

**The Three Dimensions of AI Change:**

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │    TECHNICAL    │
                    │   - Systems     │
                    │   - Integration │
                    │   - Data        │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
         ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
         ▼                   ▼                   ▼
┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐
│     PROCESS     │  │     PEOPLE      │  │    CULTURE      │
│ - Workflows     │  │ - Skills        │  │ - Values        │
│ - Roles         │  │ - Mindsets      │  │ - Norms         │
│ - Decisions     │  │ - Behaviors     │  │ - Leadership    │
└─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘
```

**Why AI Adoption Often Fails:**

| Failure Mode | Percentage | Root Cause |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Technical challenges | 25% | Data quality, integration issues |
| Lack of clear strategy | 25% | No business case, poor planning |
| Resistance/adoption issues | 30% | Fear, lack of trust, poor change management |
| Organization not ready | 20% | Culture, skills, leadership gaps |

*Key Insight:* 50%+ of failures are people and organizational issues, not technical ones.

#### 1.2 Change Management Frameworks for AI

**Kotter's 8 Steps Applied to AI:**

| Step | Traditional | AI Adaptation |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| 1. Create urgency | Business pressure | Competitive AI gap, opportunity cost |
| 2. Form coalition | Executive support | Include AI skeptics, not just enthusiasts |
| 3. Create vision | Future state | Human-AI collaboration vision |
| 4. Communicate vision | Broadcast | Two-way dialogue, address fears |
| 5. Empower action | Remove barriers | Provide time, tools, psychological safety |
| 6. Generate wins | Quick wins | Small, visible AI successes |
| 7. Build on change | Expand | Iterate, don't rush to scale |
| 8. Anchor in culture | New behaviors | AI becomes "how we work" |

**ADKAR Model for AI:**

| Element | AI Application | Actions |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Awareness** | Why AI matters | Share industry trends, competitive landscape |
| **Desire** | Want to participate | Address concerns, show personal benefits |
| **Knowledge** | How to use AI | Training, resources, practice time |
| **Ability** | Can use effectively | Coaching, support, realistic expectations |
| **Reinforcement** | Sustained use | Recognition, metrics, continuous improvement |

**Prosci Change Management Process:**

#### 1.3 AI-Specific Change Challenges

**The Trust Equation:**

```
                    Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy
Trust in AI = ─────────────────────────────────────────────
                         Self-Orientation
```

Where:
- **Credibility** = AI produces accurate outputs (builds over time)
- **Reliability** = AI behaves consistently (builds with experience)
- **Intimacy** = Users understand how AI works (builds with transparency)
- **Self-Orientation** = AI serves users, not itself (inherently low for AI, but fears exist)

**Building Trust in AI Systems:**

| Stage | Trust Level | User Behavior | Support Needed |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Initial | Skeptical | Tests everything | High oversight, quick wins |
| Developing | Conditional | Trusts familiar tasks | Expanding use cases |
| Established | Confident | Routine use | Efficiency improvements |
| Mature | Calibrated | Appropriate skepticism | Edge case handling |

**Common Psychological Barriers:**

| Barrier | Manifestation | Approach |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Fear of job loss | Resistance, sabotage | Honest communication, reskilling |
| Loss of expertise | Devaluing contributions | Reframe as "augmentation" |
| Perfectionism | Rejecting AI errors | Calibrate expectations |
| Control loss | Wanting to do it themselves | Gradual handoff |
| Change fatigue | "Not another initiative" | Show quick value, reduce burden |

### Session 2: Stakeholder and Communication Strategy (60 minutes)

#### 2.1 Stakeholder Analysis for AI Initiatives

**Extended Stakeholder Map:**

| Stakeholder Group | AI Concerns | What They Need | Engagement Strategy |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Executives** | ROI, reputation, risk | Business case, governance | Strategic briefings |
| **Middle Managers** | Team disruption, accountability | Implementation support | Coaching, tools |
| **Front-line Staff** | Job security, competence | Training, reassurance | Dialogue, involvement |
| **IT/Technical** | Integration, maintenance | Technical resources | Architecture review |
| **HR** | Policy, skills, hiring | Workforce strategy | Planning partnership |
| **Legal/Compliance** | Liability, regulations | Risk assessment | Early involvement |
| **Customers** | Privacy, service quality | Transparency | Communication plan |
| **Unions** | Job protection | Negotiation, agreements | Formal engagement |

**Power/Interest Grid:**

```
High   │ Keep Satisfied      │  Manage Closely
Power  │ (Executives who     │  (Champions, key
       │  aren't directly    │  decision-makers)
       │  involved)          │
       ├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────
       │ Monitor             │  Keep Informed
Low    │ (Peripheral         │  (Affected employees,
Power  │  stakeholders)      │  enthusiasts)
       │                     │
       └─────────────────────┴─────────────────────
              Low Interest          High Interest
```

**Stakeholder Engagement Plan Template:**

| Stakeholder | Current Position | Desired Position | Key Messages | Tactics | Owner |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|---------|-------|
| | Resistant/Neutral/Supportive/Champion | | | | |

---

#### 2.2 Communication Strategy

**Communication Planning Matrix:**

| Audience | Message | Channel | Frequency | Sender |
|----------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|
| All employees | Vision, updates | Town hall, email | Monthly | Executive |
| Affected teams | Specifics, timeline | Team meetings | Weekly | Manager |
| Pilot users | Training, feedback | Direct, Slack | Daily/weekly | Project team |
| Leadership | Progress, decisions | Dashboard, meetings | Weekly | Project lead |
| External | What customers should know | Website, CS scripts | As needed | Communications |

**Message Development Framework:**

For each audience, develop:

1. **The What:** What is happening?
2. **The Why:** Why is this happening?
3. **The Impact:** What does it mean for them specifically?
4. **The Support:** What help is available?
5. **The Ask:** What do we need from them?

**Example Messages by Audience:**

*For Front-line Employees:*
> "We're introducing AI to help with [specific tasks]. This isn't about replacing you—it's about freeing you from repetitive work so you can focus on [higher-value activities]. You'll receive training starting [date], and we'll pilot with volunteers before expanding. Your expertise is exactly why this will work—AI needs your judgment to catch errors and handle complex situations."

*For Managers:*
> "Your team will be among the first to work with our new AI capabilities. Your role is critical: you'll help shape how AI integrates with your workflows, support your team through the transition, and ensure we maintain quality. We're providing you with coaching sessions and tools to lead this change effectively."

*For Executives:*
> "Our AI initiative targets [specific business outcome] with expected ROI of [X]. We've established governance frameworks to manage risk, and change management support to ensure adoption. Key milestones are [dates]. We need your visible sponsorship and patience as we iterate toward success."

#### 2.3 Addressing AI Fears Through Communication

**Fear-Based Messaging Framework:**

| Fear | Ineffective Message | Effective Message |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Job loss | "Don't worry, your job is safe" | "Here's our commitment: [specific]. Here's where we need your expertise: [specific]. Here's how we're supporting your growth: [specific]." |
| Incompetence | "It's easy, anyone can do it" | "Learning AI tools is a new skill, like any other. We're providing training, practice time, and support. Many others have learned this successfully." |
| Loss of value | "AI will make everyone more productive" | "Your expertise is why AI works—you catch what it misses, you handle the complex cases, you bring judgment that AI can't." |
| Unknown | "Trust us, it will be fine" | "Here's what we know, here's what we're still figuring out, and here's how you can be involved in shaping this." |

**The Radical Transparency Approach:**

When possible, be radically transparent:
- Share what you know AND what you don't know
- Acknowledge concerns are valid
- Explain how decisions are being made
- Invite input and questions
- Follow up when you have new information

**Communication Don'ts:**

- Don't make promises you can't keep ("No jobs will be affected")
- Don't dismiss concerns ("That won't happen")
- Don't over-hype AI capabilities
- Don't communicate only when there's "news"
- Don't let rumors fill the information vacuum

---

#### 2.4 Exercise: Communication Plan Development

**Workshop Exercise:**

*Scenario:* Your organization is rolling out an AI assistant that will help customer service representatives handle inquiries. It will suggest responses, auto-draft routine answers, and flag complex issues for senior agents.

**Develop a communication plan:**

1. **Stakeholder list:** Who needs to know about this?

2. **Message for CS representatives:**
   - The What:
   - The Why:
   - The Impact:
   - The Support:
   - The Ask:

3. **Message for CS managers:**
   - (Same structure)

4. **FAQ development:** What questions will people ask?

5. **Channel strategy:** How will you communicate at each phase?

6. **Feedback mechanism:** How will you listen and respond?

**Change Management Principles for AI:**

1. **Transparency over reassurance** - Be honest about what you know and don't know
2. **Involvement over imposition** - Include people in designing their future
