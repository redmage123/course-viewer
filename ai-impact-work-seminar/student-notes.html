<h1>AI's Impact on Work &amp; Rolling Out AI Successfully</h1>
<p style="color:#666;font-size:1.1em;margin-bottom:5px">ITAG Skillnet AI Advantage | 90-Minute Seminar</p>
<p style="color:#888;font-size:0.95em">A practical guide to understanding how AI is reshaping the workforce and how to lead a successful AI rollout using the LAUNCH framework.</p>

<h2>1. The LAUNCH Framework</h2>

<p>The LAUNCH framework is a structured, six-step methodology for planning, executing, and sustaining an AI rollout across your organisation. Each step builds on the previous one, ensuring that AI adoption is strategic, people-centred, and measurable.</p>

<div class="framework-box">
<h3 style="text-align:center;color:#0066cc;margin-bottom:15px">The LAUNCH Framework</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Letter</th><th>Phase</th><th>Core Question</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>L</strong></td><td>Landscape Assessment</td><td>Where is AI impacting our industry right now?</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>A</strong></td><td>Alignment with Strategy</td><td>How does AI connect to our business objectives?</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>U</strong></td><td>Upskilling the Workforce</td><td>Are our people ready for AI-augmented roles?</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>N</strong></td><td>Navigate Change Management</td><td>How do we overcome resistance and build champions?</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>C</strong></td><td>Champion Quick Wins</td><td>What high-impact, low-risk pilots can we start with?</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>H</strong></td><td>Harvest &amp; Scale</td><td>How do we measure results and expand across the org?</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<h3>L -- Landscape Assessment</h3>
<p>Before adopting AI, you must understand how it is already reshaping your industry. A landscape assessment involves scanning the competitive environment, identifying where AI is creating value, and mapping the specific processes in your organisation that are most likely to be affected.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>External scan:</strong> What are competitors and industry leaders doing with AI?</li>
<li><strong>Internal audit:</strong> Which processes are repetitive, data-heavy, or time-consuming?</li>
<li><strong>Technology inventory:</strong> What tools, platforms, and data assets do you already have?</li>
<li><strong>Risk identification:</strong> Where could AI disrupt your business model if you do not act?</li>
</ul>

<h3>A -- Alignment with Strategy</h3>
<p>AI initiatives fail when they are disconnected from business strategy. This step ensures every AI project ties directly to a strategic objective -- whether that is revenue growth, cost reduction, customer experience improvement, or operational efficiency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Map each AI opportunity to a specific KPI or business goal</li>
<li>Prioritise use cases by strategic impact, feasibility, and data readiness</li>
<li>Secure executive sponsorship by framing AI in business language, not technical jargon</li>
</ul>

<h3>U -- Upskilling the Workforce</h3>
<p>Technology is only as effective as the people using it. Upskilling ensures your workforce can collaborate with AI tools rather than be replaced by them. This includes technical skills (prompt engineering, data literacy) and adaptive skills (critical thinking, creativity).</p>

<h3>N -- Navigate Change Management</h3>
<p>Resistance to AI is natural. Successful rollouts address fears head-on through transparent communication, employee involvement, and visible leadership commitment.</p>

<h3>C -- Champion Quick Wins</h3>
<p>Start with pilot projects that are low-risk but high-visibility. Quick wins build momentum, generate internal case studies, and convert sceptics into advocates.</p>

<h3>H -- Harvest &amp; Scale</h3>
<p>Once pilots prove their value, systematically measure results, document lessons learned, and expand successful initiatives across the organisation.</p>

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Tip:</strong> The LAUNCH framework is iterative, not linear. As you scale (H), you will return to Landscape Assessment (L) to identify the next wave of opportunities.</div>

<div class="notes-area"></div>

<h2>2. AI's Impact on Jobs &amp; Roles</h2>

<h3>The Numbers You Need to Know</h3>

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>Key Workforce Statistics:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>McKinsey Global Institute (2023):</strong> Up to 30% of hours currently worked could be automated by 2030, accelerated by generative AI.</li>
<li><strong>World Economic Forum (2023):</strong> 23% of jobs will change (created or displaced) in the next five years. 44% of workers' core skills will be disrupted.</li>
<li><strong>Goldman Sachs (2023):</strong> Generative AI could affect approximately 300 million full-time jobs globally, though many roles will be augmented rather than eliminated.</li>
<li><strong>OECD (2023):</strong> 27% of jobs in OECD countries are in occupations at high risk of automation.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Augmentation vs. Automation</h3>
<p>The critical distinction is between roles that AI will <strong>augment</strong> (making workers more productive) versus roles that AI will <strong>automate</strong> (replacing tasks entirely). Most roles fall on a spectrum rather than at either extreme.</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Impact Level</th><th>Role Examples</th><th>What Changes</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>High Augmentation</strong></td><td>Marketing, legal, software development, finance</td><td>AI handles drafting, analysis, and research; humans focus on strategy and judgement</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Moderate Change</strong></td><td>Project management, HR, sales, customer service</td><td>AI automates routine tasks; role shifts toward relationship-building and complex problem-solving</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>High Automation Risk</strong></td><td>Data entry, basic bookkeeping, routine reporting, scheduling</td><td>Many tasks can be fully automated; workers need reskilling into higher-value activities</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Low Impact (near-term)</strong></td><td>Skilled trades, healthcare (hands-on), emergency services</td><td>Physical dexterity, unpredictable environments, and human empathy remain difficult to automate</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>New Roles Emerging</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Prompt Engineer:</strong> Designs and optimises prompts for generative AI systems</li>
<li><strong>AI Ethics &amp; Governance Officer:</strong> Ensures responsible AI use across the organisation</li>
<li><strong>Human-AI Collaboration Specialist:</strong> Designs workflows that combine human and AI strengths</li>
<li><strong>AI Training Data Curator:</strong> Prepares, labels, and maintains datasets for AI systems</li>
<li><strong>Automation Analyst:</strong> Identifies processes suitable for AI-driven automation</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning-box"><strong>Common Misconception:</strong> "AI will take all our jobs." In reality, AI is far more likely to transform jobs than to eliminate them entirely. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will create 69 million new jobs globally while displacing 83 million -- a net shift, not a net loss, when reskilling is factored in.</div>

<div class="notes-area"></div>

<h2>3. Workforce Readiness Assessment</h2>

<p>Before rolling out AI, you need an honest picture of your organisation's readiness. Use the checklist below to evaluate where you stand across five dimensions.</p>

<h3>Readiness Assessment Checklist</h3>

<div class="framework-box">
<h3 style="color:#0066cc">Dimension 1: Leadership &amp; Vision</h3>
<ul>
<li>Senior leadership has articulated an AI vision aligned with business strategy</li>
<li>An executive sponsor has been identified for AI initiatives</li>
<li>Budget has been allocated for AI exploration and pilots</li>
<li>Leaders can communicate the "why" behind AI adoption to all employees</li>
<li>There is a clear governance structure for AI decision-making</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="framework-box">
<h3 style="color:#0066cc">Dimension 2: Data &amp; Infrastructure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Key business data is digitised and accessible</li>
<li>Data quality standards and governance policies are in place</li>
<li>IT infrastructure can support AI tools (cloud, compute, APIs)</li>
<li>Data privacy and security policies cover AI-specific risks</li>
<li>You have identified which datasets could fuel AI use cases</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="framework-box">
<h3 style="color:#0066cc">Dimension 3: Skills &amp; Talent</h3>
<ul>
<li>A skills gap analysis has been conducted for AI-relevant capabilities</li>
<li>Employees have baseline digital literacy (spreadsheets, online tools, data concepts)</li>
<li>Training programmes exist or are planned for AI tools and prompt engineering</li>
<li>You have access to AI expertise (internal team, consultants, or partners)</li>
<li>A culture of continuous learning and experimentation is encouraged</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="framework-box">
<h3 style="color:#0066cc">Dimension 4: Culture &amp; Change Readiness</h3>
<ul>
<li>Employees are generally open to new technology and process changes</li>
<li>There is a history of successful technology adoption in the organisation</li>
<li>Communication channels exist for transparent updates about AI plans</li>
<li>Employee concerns about AI have been acknowledged and addressed</li>
<li>Change champions or ambassadors have been identified in key departments</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="framework-box">
<h3 style="color:#0066cc">Dimension 5: Ethical &amp; Regulatory Readiness</h3>
<ul>
<li>You understand the EU AI Act and how it applies to your use cases</li>
<li>An AI ethics policy has been drafted or is under development</li>
<li>Processes exist for reviewing AI outputs for bias and fairness</li>
<li>You have a plan for maintaining human oversight of AI decisions</li>
<li>Legal and compliance teams have been briefed on AI adoption plans</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Scoring Guide:</strong> For each dimension, count how many items you can confirm. <strong>4-5:</strong> Ready to proceed. <strong>2-3:</strong> Address gaps before scaling. <strong>0-1:</strong> Foundational work needed before AI pilots.</div>

<div class="notes-area"></div>

<h2>4. Change Management for AI</h2>

<p>AI adoption is fundamentally a people challenge, not a technology challenge. Research consistently shows that the most common reason AI projects fail is not technical limitations -- it is organisational resistance and poor change management.</p>

<h3>The Four Fears of AI Adoption</h3>

<table>
<tr><th>Fear</th><th>What People Think</th><th>How to Address It</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Job Loss</strong></td><td>"AI will replace me."</td><td>Reframe as augmentation; show how AI handles tedious tasks so people can focus on higher-value work. Provide concrete reskilling paths.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Incompetence</strong></td><td>"I won't be able to learn this."</td><td>Start with simple, user-friendly tools. Provide hands-on training with immediate application. Celebrate small wins.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Loss of Control</strong></td><td>"AI will make decisions I disagree with."</td><td>Emphasise human-in-the-loop. Show that AI recommends, humans decide. Give employees a voice in how AI is deployed in their workflows.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Surveillance</strong></td><td>"AI will be used to monitor me."</td><td>Be transparent about what data AI tools collect. Establish clear policies on employee monitoring. Involve unions and works councils early.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>The Change Champion Model</h3>
<p>Change champions are respected employees who volunteer (or are recruited) to advocate for AI adoption within their teams. They bridge the gap between leadership vision and frontline reality.</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>Characteristics of Effective Change Champions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Respected by peers (not necessarily managers -- credibility matters more than authority)</li>
<li>Curious about technology and willing to experiment</li>
<li>Good communicators who can translate technical concepts into practical language</li>
<li>Empathetic to colleagues' concerns and willing to listen</li>
<li>Given protected time and resources to fulfil the champion role</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Communication Strategy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before launch:</strong> Explain the "why" -- why now, why this tool, why this team. Share the vision, not just the plan.</li>
<li><strong>During rollout:</strong> Provide weekly updates. Share early wins and honest setbacks. Create feedback channels.</li>
<li><strong>After initial deployment:</strong> Celebrate successes publicly. Acknowledge challenges transparently. Share metrics and ROI data.</li>
</ul>

<div class="danger-box"><strong>Critical Mistake:</strong> Announcing AI adoption via email without first engaging employees in dialogue. This approach almost guarantees resistance. Always start with face-to-face conversations (or live virtual sessions) where people can ask questions and voice concerns.</div>

<h3>Resistance Is a Signal, Not an Obstacle</h3>
<p>When employees resist AI, it is often because they have valuable information about why the current approach may not work. Listen to resistance carefully -- it frequently reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process complexities that leadership does not see</li>
<li>Data quality issues that will undermine AI accuracy</li>
<li>Customer relationship nuances that AI cannot replicate</li>
<li>Legitimate ethical or fairness concerns</li>
</ul>

<div class="notes-area"></div>

<h2>5. Building Your AI Rollout Plan</h2>

<p>The 90-day rollout plan provides a structured timeline for moving from concept to pilot to initial results. It is designed to be fast enough to maintain momentum but thorough enough to avoid costly mistakes.</p>

<h3>The 90-Day AI Rollout Plan</h3>

<div class="framework-box">
<h3 style="color:#0066cc;text-align:center">Phase 1: Discovery &amp; Alignment (Days 1-30)</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Week</th><th>Activities</th><th>Deliverables</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Week 1</strong></td><td>Stakeholder interviews, landscape assessment, identify pain points</td><td>Pain point inventory, stakeholder map</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Week 2</strong></td><td>Data audit, technology inventory, vendor shortlist</td><td>Data readiness report, technology options brief</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Week 3</strong></td><td>Use case prioritisation workshop, strategic alignment mapping</td><td>Prioritised use case list (top 3), business case draft</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Week 4</strong></td><td>Select pilot use case, define success criteria, assemble pilot team</td><td>Pilot charter, KPI dashboard template, team roster</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<div class="framework-box">
<h3 style="color:#0066cc;text-align:center">Phase 2: Build &amp; Test (Days 31-60)</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Week</th><th>Activities</th><th>Deliverables</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Week 5</strong></td><td>Tool setup, data preparation, initial configuration</td><td>Working prototype or configured tool</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Week 6</strong></td><td>Internal testing, prompt refinement, workflow integration design</td><td>Test results, refined prompts, integration plan</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Week 7</strong></td><td>Change champion training, user documentation, feedback mechanism setup</td><td>Training materials, user guide, feedback form</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Week 8</strong></td><td>Pilot team onboarding, soft launch with small group, daily check-ins</td><td>Onboarding checklist complete, initial usage data</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<div class="framework-box">
<h3 style="color:#0066cc;text-align:center">Phase 3: Pilot &amp; Learn (Days 61-90)</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Week</th><th>Activities</th><th>Deliverables</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Week 9-10</strong></td><td>Full pilot operation, weekly feedback sessions, issue resolution</td><td>Usage metrics, feedback summary, issue log</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Week 11</strong></td><td>Quantitative and qualitative evaluation, ROI calculation</td><td>Pilot evaluation report, ROI analysis</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Week 12</strong></td><td>Lessons learned workshop, scaling roadmap, executive presentation</td><td>Lessons learned document, scale plan, exec briefing deck</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Tip:</strong> The 90-day plan is a minimum viable timeline. Complex enterprise AI deployments may require 6-12 months, but the 90-day structure ensures you achieve tangible results quickly enough to maintain executive support and team enthusiasm.</div>

<h3>Use Case Prioritisation Matrix</h3>
<p>Use this matrix to evaluate and rank potential AI use cases. Score each criterion from 1 (low) to 5 (high).</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Criterion</th><th>Use Case A</th><th>Use Case B</th><th>Use Case C</th></tr>
<tr><td>Strategic alignment (how well does it support business goals?)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Data readiness (is quality data available?)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Feasibility (can we implement this with current resources?)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Expected ROI (time saved, revenue gained, cost reduced)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Risk level (1 = high risk, 5 = low risk)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Employee impact (how many people benefit?)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Total Score</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<div class="notes-area"></div>

<h2>6. Measuring AI Success &amp; ROI</h2>

<p>Without clear metrics, AI projects risk becoming expensive experiments with no accountability. Measurement must be planned from day one, not added as an afterthought.</p>

<h3>The Four Categories of AI Metrics</h3>

<table>
<tr><th>Category</th><th>Metrics</th><th>How to Measure</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Efficiency</strong></td><td>Time saved per task, process cycle time reduction, throughput increase</td><td>Before/after time studies, process logs, output volume tracking</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Quality</strong></td><td>Error rate reduction, consistency improvement, customer satisfaction scores</td><td>QA audits, customer surveys, defect tracking</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Financial</strong></td><td>Cost reduction, revenue increase, cost avoidance, ROI percentage</td><td>Financial reporting, cost centre analysis, revenue attribution</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Adoption</strong></td><td>Active users, usage frequency, feature utilisation, employee satisfaction</td><td>Platform analytics, usage dashboards, pulse surveys</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Calculating AI ROI</h3>

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>Basic AI ROI Formula:</strong>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:1.1em;margin:10px 0"><code>ROI = ((Benefits - Costs) / Costs) x 100</code></p>
<p><strong>Benefits include:</strong> Labour hours saved x hourly cost, error reduction x cost per error, revenue from new AI-enabled services, avoided costs (e.g., not hiring for tasks AI handles).</p>
<p><strong>Costs include:</strong> Software licences, implementation and integration, training and change management, ongoing maintenance and support, employee time spent learning and adapting.</p>
</div>

<h3>Sample KPI Dashboard</h3>

<table>
<tr><th>KPI</th><th>Baseline</th><th>Target (90 days)</th><th>Actual</th></tr>
<tr><td>Average task completion time</td><td>___ minutes</td><td>___% reduction</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Employee AI tool adoption rate</td><td>0%</td><td>___% of pilot team</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Error/rework rate</td><td>___%</td><td>___% reduction</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Employee satisfaction with AI tools</td><td>N/A</td><td>&gt;3.5 / 5.0</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Cost savings (monthly)</td><td>Baseline cost ___</td><td>___% reduction</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Customer satisfaction impact</td><td>Current CSAT ___</td><td>No decrease / ___% increase</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<div class="warning-box"><strong>Warning:</strong> Avoid measuring AI success solely by cost savings. Some of the most valuable AI outcomes -- improved decision quality, faster innovation cycles, enhanced employee experience -- are difficult to quantify but essential to long-term competitiveness. Use a balanced scorecard approach.</div>

<h3>When AI Projects Fail: Common Pitfalls</h3>

<div class="danger-box">
<strong>Top Reasons AI Rollouts Fail:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>No clear business problem:</strong> Technology deployed in search of a problem rather than solving an identified need.</li>
<li><strong>Poor data quality:</strong> AI is only as good as its data. Garbage in, garbage out still applies.</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring change management:</strong> Forcing new tools on employees without training, support, or input.</li>
<li><strong>Unrealistic expectations:</strong> Expecting immediate, transformative results from a pilot project.</li>
<li><strong>No executive sponsorship:</strong> Without visible leadership support, AI initiatives lose priority and funding.</li>
<li><strong>Measuring too late:</strong> Not establishing baselines before deployment makes ROI impossible to calculate.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="notes-area"></div>

<h2>Key Takeaways &amp; Quick Reference</h2>

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>Five Things to Remember:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>AI augments more than it automates.</strong> Focus on how AI makes your people better, not how it replaces them.</li>
<li><strong>Start with strategy, not technology.</strong> The best AI tool in the world fails if it does not solve a real business problem.</li>
<li><strong>Change management is the hardest part.</strong> Invest more time in people than in platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Quick wins build momentum.</strong> One successful pilot is worth more than a hundred-page strategy document.</li>
<li><strong>Measure from day one.</strong> Establish baselines before you begin so you can prove value and justify scaling.</li>
</ol>
