## Pain Point Analysis

### Ranked Pain Points

| Rank | Pain Point | Impact (H/M/L) | Frequency | Root Cause |
|------|------------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | [Biggest pain point] | [H/M/L] | [How often] | [Why it happens] |
| 2 | [Second pain point] | [H/M/L] | [How often] | [Why it happens] |
| 3 | [Third pain point] | [H/M/L] | [How often] | [Why it happens] |
| 4 | [Fourth pain point] | [H/M/L] | [How often] | [Why it happens] |
| 5 | [Fifth pain point] | [H/M/L] | [How often] | [Why it happens] |

### Questions to Challenge Current Process

- [ ] Why does step ___ exist? Is it still necessary?
- [ ] Who decided step ___ should be done this way?
- [ ] What would happen if we eliminated step ___?
- [ ] Where do people wait? Why?
- [ ] What information is collected but never used?
- [ ] What decisions could be made earlier?

## Future State Design

### Design Principles Used
- [ ] Start from outcome, not current process
- [ ] Challenge every step's necessity
- [ ] Design for human-AI collaboration
- [ ] Build in appropriate oversight
- [ ] Plan for exceptions

### Future State Steps

| Step # | Description | Actor (Human/AI) | AI Role Type | Human Checkpoint |
|--------|-------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | [What happens] | [Human/AI/Both] | [If AI] | [If/when human reviews] |
| 2 | [What happens] | [Human/AI/Both] | [If AI] | [If/when human reviews] |
| 3 | [What happens] | [Human/AI/Both] | [If AI] | [If/when human reviews] |
| 4 | [What happens] | [Human/AI/Both] | [If AI] | [If/when human reviews] |
| 5 | [What happens] | [Human/AI/Both] | [If AI] | [If/when human reviews] |
| 6 | [What happens] | [Human/AI/Both] | [If AI] | [If/when human reviews] |
