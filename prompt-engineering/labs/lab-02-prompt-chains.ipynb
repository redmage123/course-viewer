    "- Understand and debug multi-step prompt chains\n",
    "- Design prompt workflows using sequential, fan-out, and iterative patterns\n",
    "- Critically evaluate biased A/B test designs\n",
    "- Architect complex multi-step pipelines for real business tasks\n",

    "## Part 1: Understanding Prompt Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "A **prompt chain** breaks a complex task into discrete steps where the output of one step becomes the input for the next. This mirrors how humans tackle large problems: research first, then outline, then draft, then polish.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Article Writing Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a 3-step chain for writing an article about AI in healthcare:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1 \u2014 Extract Topics:**\n",
    "> Extract the 5 most important topics from the following subject: AI in healthcare\n",
    "\n",
    "*Output:*\n",
    "> 1. Current adoption rates and growth trajectory\n",
    "> 2. Primary use cases in clinical settings\n",
    "> 3. Regulatory landscape and compliance\n",
    "> 4. Cost-benefit analysis for hospital systems\n",
    "> 5. Patient outcome improvements backed by studies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2 \u2014 Create Outline** (uses Step 1's output as input):\n",
    "> Create a detailed article outline organized around these topics:\n",
    "> [paste Step 1 output]\n",
    "\n",
    "*Output:*\n",
    "> I. Introduction \u2014 The AI revolution in healthcare\n",
    ">    A. Hook: startling statistic on diagnostic errors\n",
    ">    B. Thesis: AI is transforming clinical outcomes\n",
    "> II. Adoption Landscape\n",
    ">    A. Current rates: 38% of hospitals using some form of AI\n",
    ">    B. Growth: projected 45% CAGR through 2028\n",
    "> III. Clinical Use Cases\n",
    "> *(and so on...)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3 \u2014 Write Introduction** (uses Step 2's output as input):\n",
    "> Write a compelling 150-word introduction for an article with this outline:\n",
    "> [paste Step 2 output]\n",
    "\n",
    "*Output:*\n",
    "> Every year, an estimated 12 million Americans receive a misdiagnosis. For hospital administrators, artificial intelligence offers a compelling answer...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Chains Work\n",
    "- Each step has a **focused, manageable scope**\n",
    "- The AI produces better output when given specific, narrow tasks\n",
    "- You can **inspect and fix** intermediate results before they cascade\n",
    "- You can **reuse steps** across different workflows\n",

    "## Workflow Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world prompt workflows use three common patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Sequential Pattern\n",
    "Steps run one after another. Each step's output feeds the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Step 1: Research] \u2192 [Step 2: Outline] \u2192 [Step 3: Draft] \u2192 [Step 4: Polish]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:** Article writing, report generation, email drafting\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Fan-Out Pattern\n",
    "The same prompt is applied to multiple inputs independently. Results are collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Input A] \u2192 [Same Prompt] \u2192 [Result A]\n",
    "[Input B] \u2192 [Same Prompt] \u2192 [Result B]\n",
    "[Input C] \u2192 [Same Prompt] \u2192 [Result C]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:** Batch analysis, processing multiple documents, scoring candidates\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Iterative Pattern\n",
    "The same prompt is applied repeatedly to progressively refine output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Draft v1] \u2192 [Refine Prompt] \u2192 [Draft v2] \u2192 [Refine Prompt] \u2192 [Draft v3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:** Editing, polishing, improving quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Real workflows often combine patterns. For example, a hiring pipeline might:\n",
    "1. **Fan-out:** Score each candidate on 3 dimensions\n",
    "2. **Sequential:** Rank \u2192 Select finalists \u2192 Generate interview questions \u2192 Write recommendation memo\n",
